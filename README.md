# Tic-Tac-Toe
<H1><u>TIC - TAC - TOE</u></H1>
Tic-tac-toe is a two player game in which the objective is to take turns and mark the correct spaces in a 3x3 grid. 
Think on your feet but also be careful, as the first player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game! 
How many rounds in a row can you win? 
You will be playing against a bot.

This is an Individual Project in which Min-Max Algorithm is implemented.
